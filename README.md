# interactive-phd-list

A collaborative list of  available PhDs based on  [Piotr Migda≈Ç](https://p.migdal.pl/) list of Machine Learning resources.

Anyone is encouraged to contribute!
It is a simple no-build Vue.js website:

* [p.migdal.pl/interactive-machine-learning-list/](https://p.migdal.pl/interactive-machine-learning-list/)

Feel invited to Pull Request other interactive visualizations (check [websites.yaml](https://github.com/stared/interactive-machine-learning-list/blob/master/websites.yaml))! :)

...aaand if you want to create such visualizations by yourself, see [In Browser AI](https://inbrowser.ai/).

Inspirations for collecting and displaying content:

* [Science-based games - a collaborative list](https://github.com/stared/science-based-games-list) - a list I started (maybe I will turn it int something interactive as well)
* [Kaggle Past Solutions](http://ndres.me/kaggle-past-solutions/) - a searchable compilation of Kaggle past solutions
  * source: [EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions](https://github.com/EliotAndres/kaggle-past-solutions)
* [D3 Discovery](https://d3-discovery.net/) - finding D3 plugins with ease
