  desc: "The aim of the programme is to bring together doctoral researchers from different disciplines to advance our understanding of the interactions between sensing, perception, and awareness in humans, animals, and machines. Applicants can select from a range of projects or propose their own. Pre-specified projects are divided into three main themes: (i) Human-computer interaction and digital arts, (ii) human cognitive neuroscience and computational neuroscience, and (iii) sensory neuroscience."

- name: "  The role of confidence and urgency in deciding to stop sampling information "
  desc: "Do I have enough information to decide, or should I sample more information to commit to a choice? This PhD project addresses such decisions, and how humans shift the point of commitment based on how sure they are (confidence) and how important it is to make a quick decision (urgency). This PhD project will investigate how confidence and sense of urgency influence these decisions, with a novel computational model and experimental task, using neuroimaging and neurostimulation techniques."

- name: "A model-based approach to study transfer in decision making and cognitive control"
  desc: "Many psychologists have wondered whether cognitive control can be trained, but several training studies have been unsuccessful. In this PhD project, we will develop a model-based cognitive training paradigm using a well-studied cognitive process model of learning and decision making. By manipulating specific model parameters while subjects perform cognitive control tasks, we will test whether training induces transfer of these parameter settings across tasks. Using this approach, we will also investigate whether similarities in neural pattern activation (i.e., voxel patterns) can predict transfer, to unravel the neural substrates of these potentially generalizable control processes."
